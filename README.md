# Breast Cancer Prediction App

This project is a **Streamlit** [web application](https://cancer-prediction-app.streamlit.app) that predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant using a machine learning model. The app provides an interactive interface where users can input cell nucleus measurements and visualize the results with a radar chart.

## Features
- Predicts whether a breast mass is **benign** or **malignant** based on user-provided measurements.
- Displays the prediction probabilities for both benign and malignant classes.
- Visualizes the mean, standard error, and worst-case values of measurements using a radar chart.
- Interactive sidebar with sliders to input or modify cell nucleus measurements.
- Assists medical professionals in decision-making but does not substitute professional diagnosis.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the data and model files**:
   - Place the `data.csv` file in the `data/` directory.
   - Add the trained `model.pkl` and `scaler.pkl` files to the `model/` directory.

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launch the app**:
   After running the above command, the app will open in your default web browser.

2. **Input measurements**:
   Use the sliders in the sidebar to adjust the cell nucleus measurements.

3. **View the prediction**:
   - The app will display the prediction (Benign or Malignant) along with the probability scores.
   - The radar chart will update dynamically based on the input values.

4. **Interpret results**:
   Use the prediction and visualization to analyze the cell cluster characteristics.
